# image-resize-app
A simple node utility for gathering a series of images in a folder and outputing each of them in multiple sizes.
E.g:

`landscape.jpg` -> `output` ->  `landscape_mobile.jpg`
                                `landscape_thumb.jpg`
                                `landscape_desktop.jpg`
